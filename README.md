# FL NAV

Circa 2010, I decided that the navigation in [Freelancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_%28video_game%29) was severely lacking... so I built a nav computer, and entered systems in it as I discovered them. Enter your current system and the destination system, et voila! Shortest route.

It appears to use a basic breadth-first search. Also, judging by the empty sections in the `fl_sys.py` file, this might not be a complete map.

## Usage

```
python fl_nav.py
```

OR

```
chmod +x fl_nav.py
./fl_nav.py
```
